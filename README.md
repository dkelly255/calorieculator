# CalorieCulator - Work In Progress
Note: Provisional content - work in progress & details evolving
## Introduction
- CalorieCulator is a site aimed at people who want to take control of and improve their dietary habits
- The site will initially request the user to input several key measurements (height, weight, age etc) - these measurements will then be used by JavaScript to populate a standard formula (BMR) to calculate and return a personalised daily calorie target
- The next step is to ask the user to choose their macronutrient goals from a list of three options - when combined with the calorie output from step 1, this will allow Javascript to calculate a simple personalised protein/carb/fat macro-nutrient split for the user
- Finally the site will show the user a list of common foods per macro category - the user will select/unselect their preferences & the site will use the list to generate simple meal plan ideas that fit within the user's Calorie & Macro calculations, generating combinations of food options from each category's inventory of foods to provide variety 

## User Experience
### Strategy
- #### User Stories
    - As a user of the site I would like to be able to:
        - Learn about why planning & measuring calorie intake can be beneficial for health
        - Obtain a personalised daily calorie target calculation based on my individual measurements & activity level
        - Receive macro-nutrient mix calculation based on my personalised calorie target above combined with my chosen macro-split option
        - Generate meal plan ideas based on my personal calorie target & macro mix calculations, and my chosen preferred food selections

## Features

### Existing Features
### Features Left to implement

## Testing
### Generic Testing
- I completed testing of the website pages in multiple broswers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and also used DevTools to confirm that the project is responsive, functional and aesthetically pleasing on all standard screen sizes
- Additionally I tested the site on different devices, operating systems and form factors - Desktop & Laptop (Windows) Ipad Tablet (IOS), and Galaxy Note 10 Phone (Android)

### HTML Testing
During the testing phase I used the W3C Validator to confirm that all HTML code was error free & functioned as expected

**Home Page:**

**Calorie Calculation Page:**

**Macro Mix Page HTML:**

**Meal Planning Page HTML:**

### CSS Testing
- The CSS Jigsaw Validator was used to confirm that the CSS code was error free & functioned as expected.
- As my CSS Code was contained in a single stylesheet (style.css) - I was able to validate the full website's styling via one direct input
### Javascript Testing
### Accessibility Testing
### Resolved Bugs
### Unresolved Bugs
- No unfixed bugs were present in the finalised website code
## Deployment
- The site was deployed to Github pages. The steps to display are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch
    - The link will then be provided to the completed website
